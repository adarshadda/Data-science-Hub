# Data Science Hub

Welcome to the **Data Science Hub** repository! This is a collection of personal projects and notebooks that I've worked on to enhance my skills and knowledge in the field of data science. Each notebook represents a different project, showcasing various techniques and methodologies applied to real-world problems.

## Projects

### 1. Employee Attrition Classification
This project involves predicting employee attrition using classification algorithms. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance to predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company.

### 2. Multi-Level Obesity Predictions
In this notebook, I explore multi-level models to predict obesity levels based on various features. The project includes data cleaning, feature selection, and model evaluation, providing insights into factors contributing to obesity.

### 3. Churn Predictions
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning algorithms. The notebook includes steps for data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to identify customers who are likely to churn.
